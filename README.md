``The image above (figure 1) displays the model-view-controller (MVC) for the list user interface. The TripListFragment (TLF) contains some logic, the view that will be displayed to the user, and the events required by the user interface. The TLF inflates the fragment_trip_list.xml file and returns the view to the MainActivity to be hosted (see onCreateView). TLF also inflates menu items and defines the functions that are called in response to them being pressed (see onOptionsItemSelected). These functions utilise TripListViewModel which manages (through database queries) and stores UI related data.

Two inner classes are used (TripHolder & TripAdapter) to create ViewHolders and wrap trip list items (stores a reference to an itemâ€™s view) in them for RecyclerView.

The callbacks interface is used to delegate onClick events back to MainActivity through giving TripListFragment the ability to call a function on its hosting activity.
